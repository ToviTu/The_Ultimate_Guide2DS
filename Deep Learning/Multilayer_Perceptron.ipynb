    "# Multilayer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "A multilayer perceptron is the first *deep* neural network. Simple linear models assume a linear relationship between the observation and the target. However, this is a strong assumption and it is not true in many case. Though, many problems, through manual feature transformation, can be solved by linear methods, the exact transformation is often not known. **Deep neural network** overcomes these 2 problems through **representation learning** and **non-linear transformation**. The model first learns to convert to features to a linear problem then sovle it in a linear fashion."
