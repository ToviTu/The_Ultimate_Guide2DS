    "The classical linear regression admits an observed matrix of random variable $X$ and the corresponding vector of random variable $Y$. The model assumes that $\\vec{x_i}$ for $i = 1...p$ in $X\\in R^{n\\times p}$ are iid. normally distributed, and the conditional mean of $Y$ depends on $X$ has a linear relationship with some parameters.
